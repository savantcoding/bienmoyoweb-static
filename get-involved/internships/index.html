<p>
    Over the past 6 years Bienmoyo Foundation has helped place graduate and undergraduate students
    from Wharton, Harvard and MIT in the field in Tanzania.
    In 2008, Dr. Blander developed the Harvard Global Health Innovation Sandbox Program for undergraduate students.
    This program is called an innovation "sandbox" because it involves free-form problem solving and exploration
    with local stakeholders to develop interventions that address neglected health care problems.
    Dr. Blander has also supported as a lecturer at Harvard and MIT dozens of more students and young alumni
    to work in other countries that include Rwanda, Ecuador, and Sri Lanka.
    Students who have participated in these programs have gone on to organizations such as Medtronic and McKinsey,
    and are pursuing graduate studies at Harvard Medical School, Harvard School of Education, Columbia School of Medicine,
    and Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.
</p>
<p>
    Past interns have contributed to programs such as operations at Muhimbili National Hospital
    in Dar es Salaam and nation-wide business training and
    quality improvement efforts for <a class="internal" href="/about/collaborators/#aphfta">APHFTA</a>.

        <img src="/static/images/interns/michi.ferreol.jpg" alt="photo of Michelle Ferreol" class="float-left bordered" />
        Michi Ferreol is a sophomore at Harvard College,
        where she plans to major in Sociology with a minor in Global Health.
        After spending some time doing medical field work and shadowing doctors in the Philippines,
        her home country, Michi developed an interest for studying both the private and public health sectors
        in developing countries. Her experience at <a class="internal" href="/about/collaborators/#aphfta">APHFTA</a> helped give her greater first-hand experience
        in this field and has motivated her more to do health-related work.
        She thanks APHFTA and all its kind, brilliant people for all their encouragement and hospitality!

        Sabrina Ghouse is a sophomore at Harvard, studying Social Studies, as well as Environmental Science and Public Policy.
        She was born and raised in Sri Lanka, but has lived abroad throughout much of her upbringing.
        She plans to study and become involved in the economic and social development of less developed countries.
        Sabrina spent her freshman winter term in Jaozuo, China through Harvard China Care, prior to working with Bienmoyo and <a class="internal" href="/about/collaborators/#aphfta">APHFTA</a>.
        She is grateful for the unique perspective into international development in a new cultural setting that she gained through this work in Tanzania.

        Tri Huynh is currently a senior majoring in molecular and cellular biology at Harvard University while pursuing a minor in 
        global health and health policy. Having had a tough secondary school experience, Tri realizes that the disparity in education 
        facing the next generation of youth in America and elsewhere is unacceptable. He plans to go to graduate school in education 
        and learn about fair and equal curriculum development for people from all socioeconomic backgrounds. 
        His teaching experience with <a class="internal" href="/about/collaborators/#aphfta">APHFTA</a> truly helped develop skills he will need for his future as an educator.

        She is a global health enthusiast with a special interest in social innovation and its potential to bring change

        to return to the country of her roots and help address some of the population's most pressing health concerns.  
        Outside of the classroom, she is an avid figure skater and a lover of books, scrapbooking and writing for a blog called 
        Seeing I to I, which she founded with her twin sister. Ishani is incredibly thankful for her two month internship experience 
        in Tanzania, which was made possible by the wonderful people at <a class="internal" href="/about/collaborators/#aphfta">APHFTA</a>.

        APHFTA's quality improvement internship: the impact of culture on the
        treatment of mental disorders and dementia in Tanzania, modeling the
        spread of infectious disease, and understanding the impact of clinic quality
        on population health.
